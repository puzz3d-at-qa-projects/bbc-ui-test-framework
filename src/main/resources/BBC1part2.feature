  As a user
  I want to check some question form related functionality of the BBC site
  So I can be sure that this functionality works correctly

   Scenario Outline: Handling invalid question form submission (outline version)
    Given a web browser is at BBC homepage
    And the user finds a form named 'Your questions answered: What questions do you have?'
    When the user trying to submit the form with incorrectly entered dataData
      | question       | <question> |
      | Name           | <Name>     |
      | Email          | <Email>    |
      | Contact number | <number>   |
      | Location       | <Location> |
      | Age            | <Age>      |
    Then the error message displayed
      | Error message | <Error msg> |
